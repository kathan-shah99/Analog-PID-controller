# Analog-PID-controller
The PID control is the most commonly known for control process utilized as a part of industries for controlling action. The basic technique for PID controllers makes it simple to coordinate the process output. As the term PID suggest, it comprises of three separate constant parameters which are adjus- ted in order to get ideal, steady and faster response. In the control process, the majority of control loops based upon proportional, integral and derivative controller. For specific process, the tuning of three parameters of controller is able to provide specific control action to the system. Design methods leading to an optimal and effective operation of PID controllers are economically vital for process industries. The main focus of the project is about study of OPAMP and Simulation of an analog PID Controller using the three control parameters. The Controller design is demonstrated through simulation in order to get an output of better dynamic and static performance.
